# Classification of skin cancer dermatologist level using Deep Neural Networks

<h2>The Jupyter notebook: <a href="https://github.com/fomalhautn/Classification_of_skin-cancer_Deep-Neural-Networks/blob/main/Classification_of_skin_cancer_dermatologist_level_Deep_Neural_Networks.ipynb"><em>Classification_of_skin_cancer_Deep_Neural_Networks_Anastasiia_Andriievska.ipynb</em></a></h2>
<p>This notebook demonstrates the use of transfer learning (storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different</p>
<p>but related problem) to build a model that can classify benign and malignant (melanoma) skin diseases in Python with TensorFlow 2.</p>
