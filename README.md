# Classification of skin cancer dermatologist level using Deep Neural Networks

<p>This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of transfer learning (storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it</p>
<p>to a different but related problem) to build a model that can classify benign and malignant (melanoma) skin diseases in Python with TensorFlow 2.</p>
